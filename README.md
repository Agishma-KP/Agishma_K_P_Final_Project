# üõí Customer Behavior Prediction in E-Commerce

This project analyzes e-commerce customer sessions to predict whether a user will make a purchase. Using classification models and real-world behavioral data, it identifies key patterns that influence purchasing intent.

---

## üìå Project Highlights

- **Goal**: Predict purchasing intent of online shoppers.
- **Dataset**: Real-world e-commerce session data (user behavior, session details, technical context).
- **Target**: `Revenue` (binary: purchase or not).

## üìä Workflow Summary

1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
   ‚û§ Handled missing values, encoded categorical features, scaled numerical data.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   ‚û§ Analyzed session duration, bounce rates, user types, and seasonality.  
   ‚û§ Visuals used: heatmaps, bar plots, distribution charts.

3. **Feature Engineering**  
   ‚û§ Feature selection via `mutual_info_classif` and `SelectKBest`.  
   ‚û§ Power transformation to normalize skewed data.

4. **Model Building**  
   ‚û§ Models used: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, SVC, KNN, Naive Bayes.  
   ‚û§ Handled class imbalance using **SMOTE**.

5. **Evaluation**  
   ‚û§ Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC.  
   ‚û§ Used Confusion Matrices and ROC Curves for visual evaluation.

6. **Hyperparameter Tuning**  
   ‚û§ Applied `RandomizedSearchCV` to optimize best models.

7. **Pipeline Construction & Testing**  
   ‚û§ Built a complete ML pipeline and validated it on unseen data.
